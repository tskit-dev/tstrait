# Trait simulation

This page describes how tstrait simulates traits and how to specify the effect size
distribution.

**Learning Objectives**

After this effect size page, you will be able to:

- Understand the mathematical details of the phenotype model in tstrait
- Understand how to specify distributions of simulated effect sizes
- Understand how to simulate effect size in tstrait and read its output
- Understand how to simulate effect sizes from the frequency dependence architecture

(phenotype_model)=

## Phenotype Model

tstrait simulates a vector of quantitative trait $y$ from the following additive model,

```{math}
:label: eq:phenotype-model
y = X\beta+\epsilon,
```

where $X$ is the matrix that describes the number of causal alleles in each individual, $\beta$
is the vector of effect sizes, and $\epsilon$ is the vector of environmental noise. Environmental
noise is simulated from the following distribution,

```{math}
\epsilon\sim N\left(0,V_G\cdot\frac{1-h^2}{h^2} \right),
```

where $V_G=Var(X\beta)$ and $h^2$ is the narrow-sense heritability that is defined by the
user.

The genetic values ($X\beta$) are obtained by simply adding up over all the genomes in each individual,
regardless of ploidy.

:::{seealso}
- [](genetic_value_doc) for obtaining the genetic value $X\beta$.
- [](environment_noise) for simulating environmental noise $\epsilon$.

In this documentation, we will be describing how to simulate effect sizes in tstrait.

(effect_size_dist)=

## Effect Size Distribution

The first step of trait simulation is to specify the distribution where the effect sizes will be
simulated. It can be specified in `distribution` input of {py:func}`trait_model`. We also specify
other parameters of the distribution in the function as well. For example,

```{code-cell}

import tstrait

model = tstrait.trait_model(distribution="normal", mean=0, var=1)
```

sets a trait model, where the effect sizes are simulated from a normal distribution with
mean $0$ and variance $1$. We can check the distribution name by using `.name` attribute
of a model instance.

```{code-cell}

model.name
```

tstrait uses this distribution to simulate effect size $\beta$ in the phenotype model described
in [](eq:phenotype-model). 

The following effect size distributions are supported in tstrait, and please refer to links under
**Details** for details on the input and distribution.

:::{seealso}
[](effect_size_distribution) for details on the supported distributions.

(effect_size_sim)=

## Effect Size Simulation

Effect sizes can be simulated in tstrait by using {py:func}`tstrait.sim_trait`. In the example below,
we will be simulating effect sizes of 5 causal sites from a simulated tree sequence data in
[msprime](msprime:sec_intro).

```{code-cell}

import msprime

ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(
    samples=10_000,
    recombination_rate=1e-8,
    sequence_length=100_000,
    population_size=10_000,
    random_seed=200,
)
ts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=1e-6, random_seed=200)

trait_df = tstrait.sim_trait(ts, num_causal=5, model=model, random_seed=1)
trait_df
```

The trait dataframe has 6 columns:

> - **position**: Position of sites that have causal allele in genome coordinates.
> - **site_id**: Site IDs that have causal allele.
> - **effect_size**: Simulated effect size of causal allele.
> - **causal_allele**: Causal allele.
> - **allele_freq**: Allele frequency of causal allele.
> - **trait_id**: Trait ID that will be used in multi-trait simulation (See
[](multi_trait) for details).

Next, we will be showing the distribution of simulated effect sizes by using
a normal distribution trait model with 1,000 causal sites.

```{code-cell}

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

model = tstrait.trait_model(distribution="normal", mean=0, var=1)
trait_df = tstrait.sim_trait(ts, num_causal=1000, model=model, random_seed=1)
trait_df.head()
plt.hist(trait_df["effect_size"], bins=40)
plt.title("Simulated Effect Size")
plt.show()
```

We see that the simulated effect sizes are approximately following a $N(0,1)$
distribution, which coincides with the fact that we had specified a normal
distribution trait model with mean 0 and variance 1.

:::{note}
The site ID represents the IDs of causal sites, and information regarding the site can be
extracted by using `` .site() ``.
:::

The below code is used to extract information of site with ID 0 from `ts` tree sequence.

```{code-cell}

# Extract information of site with ID 0
ts.site(0)
```

The details of sites in tree sequences can be found [here](tskit:sec_site_table_definition).


(trait_frequency_dependence)=

## Frequency dependence

Tstrait supports frequency dependence simulation. It has been shown that rare variants
have increased effect sizes compared with common variants
[Speed et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3865), so more realistic simulations
can be made possible by increasing the effect size on rarer variants. The `alpha`
parameter in {py:func}`sim_phenotype` and {py:func}`sim_trait` are used to control
the degree of frequency dependence on simulated effect sizes.

In the frequency dependence model, the following value is multiplied to the effect size:

```{math}
:label: eq:freq-dep
[2p(1-p)^\alpha]
```

In the above expression, $p$ is the frequency of the causal allele, and
$\alpha$ is the `alpha` input of {py:func}`sim_phenotype` and
{py:func}`sim_trait`. Putting a negative $\alpha$ value increases the
magnitude of effect sizes on rare variants.

:::{note}
The default `alpha` parameter in {py:func}`sim_phenotype` and
{py:func}`sim_trait` are 0, and frequency dependent model is not used. Please
ignore the `alpha` parameter if you are not interested in implementing the
frequency dependent model.
:::

The frequency dependence architecture is still an ongoing research topic. While the
frequency dependence model can be used for any trait models in tstrait, it is
suggested that you use the normal distribution with mean 0 as a trait model and
`alpha` to be -1/2 to conduct simulations that are widely used in
simulation-based research projects (See
[Speed et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3865) for details).

In the below example, we will be demonstrating how `alpha` influences the simulated
effect sizes by using a simulated tree sequence with 10,000 individuals.

```{code-cell}

ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(
    samples=10_000,
    recombination_rate=1e-8,
    sequence_length=1_000_000,
    population_size=10_000,
    random_seed=300,
)
ts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=1e-8, random_seed=303)
model = tstrait.trait_model(distribution="normal", mean=0, var=1)
```

We will first simulate effect sizes by using the non-frequency dependent model
(`alpha` = 0), and visualize the simulated effect sizes. This is the default
`alpha` parameter in {py:func}`sim_trait`, so there is no need for you to specify
it in your trait simulation.

```{code-cell}

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# trait.sim_trait(ts, num_causal=1000, model=model, random_seed=1)
# also works here
trait_df = tstrait.sim_trait(ts, num_causal=1000, model=model, 
                             alpha=0, random_seed=1)

plt.scatter(trait_df.allele_freq, trait_df.effect_size)
plt.xlabel("Allele frequency")
plt.ylabel("Effect size")
plt.axhline(y=0, color='r', linestyle='-')
plt.title("Non-frequency dependent model, alpha = 0")
plt.show()
```

We see no relationship between allele frequency and effect size. As a next example,
we will be simulating effect sizes with `alpha` = -1/2.

```{code-cell}

trait_df = tstrait.sim_trait(ts, num_causal=1000, model=model, 
                             alpha=-1/2, random_seed=1)

plt.scatter(trait_df.allele_freq, trait_df.effect_size)
plt.xlabel("Allele frequency")
plt.ylabel("Effect size")
plt.axhline(y=0, color='r', linestyle='-')
plt.title("Frequency dependent model, alpha = -1/2")
plt.show()
```

We see that rarer variants have increased effect sizes, as expected from
the mathematical expression given in [](eq:freq-dep).
