# Genetic value

This page will describe how to simulate genetic values by using {py:func}`genetic_value` function. Genetic
values of individuals are described by $X\beta$, where $X$ is the matrix that describes
the number of causal alleles in each individual and $\beta$ is the vector of effect sizes. See
{ref}`phenotype_model` for mathematical details on the quantitative trait model.

**Learning Objectives**

After this genetic value page, you will be able to:

- Understand how to generate genetic value in tstrait
- Understand how to use the user's defined effect sizes to generate genetic values

# Algorithm Overview

Genetic value is computed in tstrait by using the trait information in the input trait dataframe.
It uses a tree traversal algorithm to count the number of causal allele in each individual and adds
the corresponding effect size to individual's genetic value.

## Input

The input of {py:func}`genetic_value` function is the following:

ts

: Tree sequence input.

trait_df

: Trait dataframe that is described in [](effect_size_sim). There are some requirements for the trait
  dataframe input, which are described in [](req_trait_df).

The details of the parameters and how they influence the genetic value simulation are described in detail
below.

## Genetic value computation

In this example, we will be showing how to compute genetic values by using the simulated trait dataframe
in {py:func}`genetic_value`.

We will be simulating a sample tree sequence data with 5 individuals by using [msprime](msprime:sec_intro),
and we will simulate a trait dataframe with 3 causal sites. The dataframe output of {py:func}`sim_trait`
can be automatically used as an input of {py:func}`genetic_value`, so there is no need to worry about input
data requirements.

:::

```{code-cell}

import msprime
import tstrait

ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(
    samples=5,
    recombination_rate=1e-8,
    sequence_length=100_000,
    population_size=10_000,
    random_seed=100,
)
ts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=1e-8, random_seed=101)
model = tstrait.trait_model(distribution="normal", mean=0, var=1)
trait_df = tstrait.sim_trait(ts, num_causal=3, model=model, random_seed=5)
trait_df
```

Please refer to [](effect_size_sim) for details on the trait dataframe output and effect size
simulation by using {py:func}`sim_trait`.

Next, we will be using the trait dataframe to generate genetic values by using {py:func}`genetic_value`.

```{code-cell}

genetic_df = tstrait.genetic_value(ts, trait_df)
genetic_df
```

The output of {py:func}`genetic_value` is a {py:class}`pandas.DataFrame` object that describes
the genetic values of individuals.

The genetic value dataframe includes the following columns:

> - **trait_id**: Trait ID that will be used in multi-trait simulation.
> - **individual_id**: Individual ID inside the tree sequence input.
> - **genetic_value**: Simulated genetic values.

(genetic_user)=

### User defined trait dataframe

We will be demonstrating how to simulate genetic values from a user defined trait dataframe.

(req_trait_df)=

### Dataframe requirements

There are some requirements for the trait dataframe input:

#### Columns

The following columns must be included in `trait_df`:

> - **site_id**: Site IDs that have causal allele.
> - **effect_size**: Simulated effect size of causal allele.
> - **causal_allele**: Causal allele.
> - **trait_id**: Trait ID.

:::{note}
The IDs in the trait_id column must start from 0 and be a consecutive integer. The IDs in the site_id
column must be non-decreasing.
:::

If you are simulating single traits, `trait_id` must be an array of zeros. The method
{py:meth}`pandas.DataFrame.sort_values` can be used to sort the dataframe based on `site_id`.

#### Data requirements

> - Site IDs in **site_id** column must be sorted in an ascending order. Please refer to
>   {py:meth}`pandas.DataFrame.sort_values` for details on sorting values in a
>   {class}`pandas.DataFrame`.
> - Trait IDs in **trait_id** column must start from zero and be consecutive.

We will be demonstrating how to simulate genetic values with 1 causal site.

```{code-cell}

import pandas as pd

data = {"site_id": [0], "effect_size": [1], "trait_id": [0],
        "causal_allele": ["1"]}
trait_df = pd.DataFrame(data)
trait_df
```

```{code-cell}
ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(
    samples=5,
    recombination_rate=1e-8,
    sequence_length=100_000,
    population_size=10_000,
    random_seed=100,
)
ts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=1e-6, model="binary", random_seed=10)
genetic_df = tstrait.genetic_value(ts, trait_df)
genetic_df
```

As seen in the genetic value dataframe, the genetic values of individuals are multiples
of 1. This is because 1 is the only effect size in the effect size dataframe, and the
{py:func}`genetic_value` function is counting the number of causal alleles of site 0
inside the individual.

Next, we will be inputting an effect size dataframe with multiple causal sites.

```{code-cell}

data = {"site_id": [0, 2, 4], "effect_size": [1, 10, 100],
        "causal_allele": ["1", "1", "1"], "trait_id": [0, 0, 0]}
trait_df = pd.DataFrame(data)
trait_df = trait_df.sort_values(by=["site_id"])
trait_df
```

The site IDs in `"site_id"` column in the trait dataframe must be sorted in an
ascending order, so it is suggested to use `.sort_values(by=['site_id'])`
code before inputting it inside the {py:func}`genetic_value` function.

```{code-cell}

genetic_df = tstrait.genetic_value(ts, trait_df)
genetic_df.head()
```
